        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I'm a CS Major at BYU. I graduate this April.</p>
        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <a href="https://github.com/caedm/wall-ink"><h2>Wall-Ink</h2></a>
        <p>Wall-Ink is a scheduling display system that was built for BYU CAEDM. It costs about $80 per unit to build, making it a whole order of magnitude cheaper. It's totally wireless, so installation cost is just so tape. Lasts 6 months to 1 year on 3 AA batteries. I did most of the programming for both the firmware and the server.</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/AndersenJ/flashcard-pixel-dungeon"><h2>Flashcard Pixel Dungeon</h2></a>
        <p>FlashCard Pixel Dungeon is a fork of Shattered Pixel Dungeon that I made with 6 other students for CS428. The idea was to take an existing, fun, and open-source game and add a learning element to it. It mostly works, but there are a couple of serious bugs that will need to be fixed before it'll be ready for real use.</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/AndersenJ/spoiler-alert"><h2>Spoiler Alert</h2></a>
        <p>Spoiler Alert was a project I made with my wife to remind us when our food was going to spoil. It turned out okay, but not great. Neither of us use it anymore.</p>
        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <p>I've worked at the following places:
        <ol>
            <li>The Provo MTC</li>
            <li>BYU Broadcasting</li>
            <li>BYU OIT</li>
            <li>BYU CAEDM</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Contact</h1>
        <p>My github account is <a href="https://github.com/AndersenJ">AndersenJ</a>. I don't have a linkedin account because linkedin is garbage. I deleted my account after they illegally spammed me for a while. Everything there felt super weird and fake anyways.</p>
